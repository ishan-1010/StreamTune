<!-- About -->
<h2>About</h2>

StreamTune is an interactive web application built with Streamlit for tuning hyperparameters of machine learning models. With StreamTune, you can easily upload your own dataset or use sample datasets like Iris and Breast Cancer. The app provides a range of models to choose from, allowing you to tune their hyperparameters and compare their performances side by side.

<!-- Sample Datasets -->
<h2>Sample Datasets</h2>

- Iris
- Breast Cancer

<!-- Getting Started -->
<h2>Getting Started</h2>

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/streamtune-app.git
```


2. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3. Run the Streamlit app:

```
streamlit run streamtune.py
```


4. The app will open in your browser. Upload your dataset or use a sample dataset to get started.

<!-- Model Selection -->
